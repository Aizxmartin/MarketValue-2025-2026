We've provided a valuation report using a consistent, data-driven adjustment model designed for real-time market pricing—not retrospective appraisals. All comparable properties were selected within a 20% range of the subject's above-grade square footage and adjusted using a tiered system that distinguishes above-grade, basement, and finished basement areas separately.

Market Range: ${price_range}
• The starting value (${avg_start:,}) reflects an average of public-facing automated estimates from RealAVM, Zillow, and Redfin.
• The ending value (${avg_comps:,}) is derived from the average of adjusted comparable sales.
